# Dragonfly Room Reverb for MPC OS

An unofficial port of the [Dragonfly Reverb](https://github.com/michaelwillis/dragonfly-reverb) Room plugin (3.2.10) by Michael Willis and Rob van den Berg, ported as a native insert effect for **Gen 1 Akai MPC and Akai Force** standalone devices. It features a touchscreen page modelled on the original plugin's UI, Q-Link mapping, 25 presets in 5 banks, full EQ control, and project recall.

## Install

Two ways, from the same [Releases](../../releases). Use one per device (see [docs/CATALOG.md](docs/CATALOG.md)).

**From the [MPC OS Plugin Catalog](https://sd88me.github.io/mpc-vst-plugins/)**: download `<Name>-<version>-mpc-armv7.zip` with an `install.sh`; the zip's `INSTALL.md` has the steps.

**Force VST plugins distribution**: download `Dragonfly-Reverb-for-MPC-OS-<version>.zip`. It follows the Force VST plugins distribution layout ([docs/DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md)): one self-contained folder per plugin.

Requires a Gen 1 Akai Force or MPC with SSH access (modded firmware such as MockbaMod) and the distribution's `Synths` folder with `vstscanner.sh`. The steps are written for the **Akai Force with MockbaMod**, which mounts its memory card at `/media/662522`:

1. Copy the `Dragonfly - VST - Room` folder into `/media/662522/Synths` (next to `vstscanner.sh`).
2. On the device: `sh /media/662522/Synths/vstscanner.sh` (afterwards just `vstscanner`). MPC restarts; the plugin is under VST, manufacturer "Dragonfly".

Other custom firmware (for example Hakai), or no `662522` card: put the folder in a `Synths` folder on any drive under `/media` (e.g. `/media/az01-internal/Synths`), find MPC's settings file (`find / -name MPC.settings`), and run `sh <that Synths folder>/vstscanner.sh <settings path>`. The release's README has the full steps, updating from 1.1.x, and troubleshooting.

## Screenshots

Rendered from the built page by `tools/screenshot.py`, at the default settings. The spectrograms are computed at build time per preset, exactly as upstream's (`vst/spectrogram_dump.cpp` + `vst/df_paint.py`), and follow the selected preset.

## Status

Alpha. Everything is tested offline (below), including the real ARM binaries under emulation, and the plugin runs on a Force. Room is one of the four Dragonfly reverb variants; CPU load per instance has not been measured yet (Hall is the heaviest).

## How it works

- `src/dragonfly/`: upstream's DSP code only (no DPF, no desktop UI), vendored with its artwork; see [`src/VENDORED.md`](src/VENDORED.md) for the exact commit and the one local fix. `src/shim/` stands in for the three DPF headers the DSP includes.
- `vst/dsp_glue.cpp`: the only file that sees upstream's headers; a small C API for Room (`vst/dsp_glue.h`).
- `vst/dragonfly_vst.cpp`: a hand-written VST2 **effect** wrapper (stereo in/out, no Steinberg SDK), with the parameter conventions of [mpc-vst-plugins](https://github.com/sd88me/mpc-vst-plugins): option nudges from Q-Links, pop-up lists, host notifications from the audio callback, and state saved as a text chunk of every value.
- Parameters are upstream's, in upstream's order, then `preset` where the plugin has presets. `vst/dump_params.cpp` writes each `params.json` from upstream's `DistrhoPluginInfo.h`, so the list can't drift. Never reorder them: MPC stores values by index.
- Pages: `vst/df_skin.py` holds one page spec per plugin and writes `vst/<p>/layout.conf` (generated; edit the spec). The kit's `gen_vst.py` builds the skin, then `vst/df_paint.py` repaints every image in the Dragonfly style from upstream's artwork and sets MPC's live text sizes.
- Target: armv7-a, VFPv3-D16, hard-float, Thumb-2; the C++ runtime is linked in; only `VSTPluginMain` is exported; glibc <= 2.36.

## Build

```
git clone https://github.com/sd88me/mpc-vst-plugins ../mpc-vst-plugins
git -C ../mpc-vst-plugins checkout c0394f0352d77072f345bd929d26c6fc09bc34a0   # the commit CI uses
pip install ziglang==0.16.0 pillow numpy
TOOLCHAIN=zig vst/build.sh room
```

Needs python3, a host gcc/g++, and Zig (above; what CI uses). `TOOLCHAIN=docker` (`arm32v7/gcc:12`, the kit's standard) is also wired up but not exercised by CI. Output per plugin is in `vst/room/build/`. Set `MPC_VST` if the kit isn't at `../mpc-vst-plugins`.

## Test

```
sudo apt install qemu-user libc6-armhf-cross     # to also test the real ARM binaries
vst/test.sh room
```

`vst/effect_test.c` loads a plugin the way MPC does and checks: instances, the stereo effect ABI, every parameter's name, display and round trip, option nudges, every preset (loads, reports to the host, renders sane audio), the pop-up, impulse to finite decaying tail, silence, in-place and legacy processing, odd block sizes, chunk save/restore, foreign chunks refused, 48 kHz, and a parameter sweep during playback. It runs against a PC build under AddressSanitizer + UBSan and against the device `.so` files under qemu-arm.

## Package and release

- `tools/package.sh` builds `dist/Dragonfly-Reverb-for-MPC-OS-<VERSION>.zip` in the distribution layout ([docs/DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md)), `dist/SHA256SUMS` and the release notes (from this version's `CHANGELOG.md` section).
- `tools/screenshot.py room <out.png>` renders a page as MPC lays it out, for `docs/screenshots/`.
- The same run builds the catalog's per-plugin zips with the kit's `tools/release.py` and checks them with its `catalog_check.py` (needs `REPO=owner/name` locally; CI uses the GitHub repo). `tools/catalog_entries.py` writes the catalog registry entries. See [docs/CATALOG.md](docs/CATALOG.md).
- CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) builds, tests and packages every push and pull request (the zips are a workflow artifact). To release: bump `VERSION` (X.Y.Z), add its section to `CHANGELOG.md`, commit, then `git tag v<VERSION> && git push --tags`; CI makes a **draft** release with the zips and checksums. Test the zips on a device, then publish it.
